# Gibbs-Marangoni pressure
This model is made to numerically solve the **modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation** from Duignan (2021) in Julia. This equation is modified as it not only includes a electrostatic potential, but also an adsorption energy function of the present ions [1].

\
The model needs the following input:
- concentration of salt;
- hydrated radius of each ion;
- adsorption energy function as a function of distance from the gas-liquid interface (for each ion).

\
As output, the electrostatic potential of salts at the interface is obtained. This can be used to calculate the surface excess of ions, which results in the **Gibbs-Marangoni pressure**.
